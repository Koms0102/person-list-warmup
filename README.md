# Person List Warmup

For this warmup, generate a new base application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Your primary objective is to create a simple list to save users & usernames to.
Your Application should be able to:
- Display a list of users with their usernames. If there are no users, display "No Users" where the list would be
- Add new users, complete with a name and username, through an HTML form
- (Stretch) Delete users from the list
- (Stretch) Edit an existing user on the list to change their name and/or username

The user entity should at least have a name and username, and preferably an ID associated with it.
If you manage to complete the two base requirements, challenge yourself to finish the stretch goals, or add some nice styles with CSS.


For reference, below are some pictures of a possible (ugly) implementation.
